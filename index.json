However, this model assumes the homogeneity of the error term's variance. Breaking this assumption, known as homoscedasticity, can bias estimates and, consequently, may change a study's conclusions. If this assumption is unmet, the mixed-effect location-scale model (MELSM) offers a solution to account for within-individual variability. Our work explores how LMMs and MELSMs behave when the homoscedasticity assumption is not met. Further, we study how misspecification affects inference for MELSM. To this aim, we propose a simulation study with longitudinal data and evaluate the estimates' bias and coverage. Our simulations show that neglecting heteroscedasticity in LMMs leads to loss of coverage for the estimated coefficients and biases the estimates of the standard deviations of the random effects. In MELSMs, scale misspecification does not bias the location model, but location misspecification alters the scale estimates. Our simulation study illustrates the importance of modelling heteroscedasticity, with potential implications beyond mixed effect models, for generalised linear mixed models for non-normal outcomes and joint models with survival data.

When the study population consists of heterogeneous subgroups, the standard JM may be inadequate and lead to misleading results. Joint latent class models (JLCMs) and their variants have been proposed to incorporate latent class structures into JMs. JLCMs are useful for identifying latent subgroup structures, obtaining a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between longitudinal outcomes, and improving prediction performance. We consider the generic form of JLCM, which poses significant computational challenges for both frequentist and Bayesian approaches due to the numerical intractability and multimodality of the associated model's likelihood or posterior. Focusing on the less explored Bayesian paradigm, we propose a new Bayesian inference framework to tackle key limitations in the existing method. Our algorithm leverages state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques and parallel computing for parameter estimation and model selection. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed method over the existing approach. Our simulations also generate important computational insights and practical guidance for implementing such complex models.

Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a widely used tool to estimate causal effects using genetic variants as instrumental variables. MR is limited to cross-sectional summary statistics of different samples and time points to analyse time-varying effects. We aimed at using longitudinal summary statistics for an exposure in a multivariable MR setting and validating the effect estimates for the mean, slope and within-individual variability.\nSimulation study. We tested our approach in various scenarios for power and type I error, depending on the correlation structure between the mean, slope and variability, and regression model. We observed high power to detect causal effects of the mean and slope throughout the simulation, but the variability effect was low powered in case of correlation between the mean and variability. Mis-specified regression models led to lower power and increased the type I error.\nReal data application. We applied our approach to two real data sets (POPS, UK Biobank). We detected significant causal estimates for both the mean and the slope in both cases, but no effect of the variability. However, even in the UK Biobank we only had weak instruments.\nConclusion. We used a new approach to test a time-varying exposure for causal effects of the exposure’s mean, slope and variability. The simulation with strong instruments seems promising, but also highlights three crucial points: 1) the difficulty to define the correct exposure regression model, 2) the dependency on the genetic correlation, and 3) the lack of strong instruments in real data. Taken together, this demands a cautious evaluation of the results, taking into account known biology and trajectory of the exposure.","tags":["GAMLSS","Mendelian Randomization","Longitudinal data"],"title":"Mendelian Randomization with longitudinal exposure data: simulation study and real data application","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Bondi","Beatrice Franzolini","Marco Palma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1744156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1744156800,"objectID":"aa06528afda2a31f7b057b925dd2e05b","permalink":"/publication/gender-gap-rir/","publishdate":"2025-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gender-gap-rir/","section":"publication","summary":"The gender disparity in school grades, known as the grade gender gap, has become a focal point for researchers, educators, and policymakers.

Simple summary statistics (e.g. the standard deviation for each individual) are often used but they are not suited to account for time changes. In addition, when these summary statistics are used as covariates in a regression model for time-to-event outcomes, the estimates of the hazard ratios are subject to regression dilution. To overcome these issues, a joint model is built where the association between the time-to-event outcome and multivariate longitudinal markers is specified in terms of the within-individual variability of the latter. A mixed-effect location-scale model is used to analyse the longitudinal biomarkers, their within-individual variability and their correlation. The time to event is modelled using a proportional hazard regression model, with a flexible specification of the baseline hazard, and the information from the longitudinal biomarkers is shared as a function of the random effects. The model can be used to quantify within-individual variability for the longitudinal markers and their association with the time-to-event outcome. We show through a simulation study the performance of the model in comparison with the standard joint model with constant variance. The model is applied on a dataset of adult women from the UK cystic fibrosis registry, to evaluate the association between lung function, malnutrition and mortality.","tags":["Within-individual variability","Joint modelling","Cystic fibrosis"],"title":"A Bayesian location-scale joint model for time-to-event and multivariate longitudinal data with association based on within-individual variability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Palma","Shahin Tavakoli","Julia Brettschneider","Ana-Maria Staicu","Thomas E.

Their approach disregards potentially useful information, particularly the fluctuations of the repeated measurements around the mean trajectory (within-individual variability), which could impact on females with CF and their survival gap with males. Valid estimates of the association of the two correlated measures and their within-individual variability with mortality are needed to provide a richer characterisation of disease progression. We propose a novel statistical model to simultaneously analyse the correlation between FEV1 and BMI over time, their within-individual variability and their association with mortality. We examined annual review data from a randomly sampled cohort of women from the UK CF registry (N = 657, aged \u003e18 years, with administrative censoring at the age of 50). A proportional hazards model is used to quantify the associations of FEV1, BMI and their within-individual variabilities with the risk of death, adjusted for year of birth, age at diagnosis and F508 genotype. Women with higher BMI tend to have higher BMI within-individual variability and higher FEV1 on average. Lower risk of death is obtained for women with higher mean FEV1 in dL (HR = 0.829, 95% Bayesian credible interval [0.802, 0.857]) and higher BMI (HR = 0.920 [0.872, 0.973]). Evidence of non-zero within-individual variability is found for both FEV1 and BMI, but only higher FEV1 within-individual variability in dL is associated with a higher risk of death (HR = 1.126 [1.007, 1.260]). Modelling jointly FEV1 and BMI over time in adults brings new insights on the evolution of cystic fibrosis and the quantification of mortality risk. A better characterisation of these associations could improve dynamic risk prediction in clinical settings in the future.","tags":["Within-individual variability","Cystic fibrosis","Joint modelling"],"title":"EPS6.09 Association of within-individual variability of FEV1 and BMI with mortality in women with cystic fibrosis: preliminary results from the UK Registry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Palma","Ruth H Keogh","Siobhán B Carr","Rhonda Szczesniak","David Taylor-Robinson","Angela M Wood","Graciela Muniz-Terrera","Jessica K Barrett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1709596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709596800,"objectID":"87e53de08f8e0de089907b8f32d54a48","permalink":"/publication/cf_wiv/","publishdate":"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cf_wiv/","section":"publication","summary":"Lung function is a key outcome used in the evaluation of disease progression in cystic fibrosis.

Over time, new words enter the lexicon, others become obsolete, and existing words acquire new senses. Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a central challenge in diachronic research. Historical corpora of classical languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, typically come with rich metadata, and existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual information beyond the document timestamp. While embedding-based methods feature among the current state of the art systems, they are lacking in the interpretative power. In contrast, Bayesian models provide explicit and interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. In this chapter we build on GASC, a recent computational approach to semantic change based on a dynamic Bayesian mixture model. In this model, the evolution of word senses over time is based not only on distributional information of lexical nature, but also on text genres. We provide a systematic comparison of dynamic Bayesian mixture models for semantic change with state-of-the-art embedding-based models. On top of providing a full description of meaning change over time, we show that Bayesian mixture models are highly competitive approaches to detect binary semantic change in both Ancient Greek and Latin.","tags":["Linguistics","Ancient Greek"],"title":"Lexical semantic change for Ancient Greek and Latin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Bigoni","Marco Palma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611187200,"objectID":"8a8305aa49d90242c01889da3fcd0058","permalink":"/publication/vortit-it/","publishdate":"2021-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vortit-it/","section":"publication","summary":"The task of translating ancient languages into Italian has distinctive features with respect translating from modern, currently spoken languages.

Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a central challenge in diachronic research, and is relevant to a range of NLP tasks, including information retrieval and semantic search in historical texts. Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge, providing explicit and interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. However, while corpora typically come with rich metadata, existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual information (such as text genre) beyond the document time-stamp. This is particularly critical in the case of ancient languages, where lack of data and long diachronic span make it harder to draw a clear distinction between polysemy (the fact that a word has several senses) and semantic change (the process of acquiring, losing, or changing senses), and current systems perform poorly on these languages. We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model that leverages categorical metadata about the texts' genre to boost inference and uncover the evolution of meanings in Ancient Greek corpora. In a new evaluation framework, our model achieves improved predictive performance compared to the state of the art.","tags":["Linguistics","Ancient Greek"],"title":"GASC: Genre-Aware Semantic Change for Ancient Greek","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is an imaging technique that aims at showing local differences in brain volume with respect to a common template.
